# Week 7 Assignment

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in numerous deaths in the United States.  Each state managed the pandemic in its own unique way and the results were not consistent from state-to-state.  This project will create a choropleth map of the USA and display each State's COVID-19 *Crude Death Rate*.  The crude death rate is a ratio between the number of deaths and the State's population.

## DataSet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main dataset used in this assignment was obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It is a collection of COVID-19 deaths as reported to the NCHS by sex, age, group, and jurisdiction of occurrence.  The dataset can be downloaded from <a href='https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Sex-and-Age/9bhg-hcku/about_data'>Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age</a>.  In addition, I used estimated U.S. State population statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau that was accessed on 2024-FEB-26 from <a href='https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2020-2023/state/totals/NST-EST2023-POP.xlsx'>Population Estimates, Population Change, and Components of Change</a>.  The State abbreviation dataset was manually created from internet sources.
